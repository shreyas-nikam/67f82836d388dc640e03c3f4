# Portfolio Optimization Lab - QuLab

This repository contains a Streamlit application for the Portfolio Optimization Lab as demonstrated by QuantUniversity.

## Overview

The application provides an interactive environment to explore portfolio optimization techniques based on the classical Markowitz model. The app is structured into multiple pages and includes interactive visualizations, portfolio constraints exploration, and explanations of the factor covariance model.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Multi-page structure with separate sections for Portfolio Optimization and Factor Covariance Model.
- **Risk-Return Trade-off Visualization:** Explore how risk aversion impacts portfolio risk and return.
- **Return Distribution Analysis:** Display distribution of returns for different risk aversion levels.
- **Portfolio Constraints Exploration:** Adjust leverage limits and view optimal portfolio allocations.
- **Factor Covariance Model Explanation:** Overview and benefits of using a factor model to model asset risks.

## Project Structure
