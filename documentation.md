## Introduction to QuLab
Duration: 00:05

Welcome to the QuLab codelab! This guide will walk you through the functionalities of the QuLab application, a Streamlit-based tool designed to illustrate key concepts in portfolio optimization and risk management.

In today's financial landscape, understanding portfolio optimization is crucial for making informed investment decisions. This application provides a hands-on experience with classical Markowitz portfolio optimization and introduces the concept of factor covariance models. By the end of this codelab, you will gain a solid understanding of:

*   **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT):** Learn the fundamentals of balancing risk and return in portfolio construction.
*   **Markowitz Optimization:** Explore the classical approach to finding optimal portfolio weights.
*   **Risk-Return Trade-off:** Understand how different levels of risk aversion impact portfolio allocation and expected returns.
*   **Factor Covariance Models:** Get introduced to techniques that simplify covariance matrix estimation and capture systematic risk factors.

This codelab is designed for developers and anyone interested in quantitative finance and financial modeling. Let's dive in and explore the world of portfolio optimization with QuLab!

## Application Overview and Navigation
Duration: 00:03

The QuLab application is structured into three main sections, accessible through the sidebar on the left:

1.  **Overview:** Provides a brief introduction to the application and its purpose.
2.  **Portfolio Optimization:**  The core interactive section where you can experiment with portfolio optimization parameters and visualize the risk-return trade-off.
3.  **Factor Covariance Model:**  Explains the concept of factor covariance models and their advantages in risk management.

Upon launching the application, you will be greeted with the **Overview** page. Let's explore each section in detail.

## Exploring the Overview Page
Duration: 00:02

Navigate to the **Overview** page by selecting "Overview" from the sidebar menu.

This page serves as the landing page and provides a brief introduction to the QuLab application. It highlights the application's focus on portfolio allocation, risk-return trade-offs, and Markowitz optimization techniques.

<aside class="positive">
This <b>Overview</b> page is designed to quickly orient users and set the context for the application's functionalities. It's a good practice to include a clear and concise introduction in any application to guide new users.
</aside>

## Diving into Portfolio Optimization
Duration: 00:15

Now, let's explore the heart of the application: the **Portfolio Optimization** page. Select "Portfolio Optimization" from the sidebar menu.

This page allows you to interact with a classical Markowitz portfolio optimization model. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:

### User Input Parameters

You'll find several interactive elements that control the portfolio optimization process:

*   **Number of Assets (n):** A slider to adjust the number of assets in the portfolio (from 5 to 50). This parameter affects the complexity of the optimization problem and the dimensionality of the covariance matrix.
*   **Risk Aversion (γ):** A slider to control the risk aversion parameter (from 0.01 to 10.0).  A higher risk aversion value (γ) means the investor is more risk-averse, leading to portfolios with lower risk but potentially lower returns.
*   **Long-Only Portfolio:** A checkbox to constrain the portfolio to be long-only. When checked, portfolio weights are restricted to be non-negative, meaning no short-selling is allowed. Unchecking this allows for short-selling.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Experiment with these parameters!</b> Changing the number of assets and risk aversion will dynamically update the optimal portfolio and the risk-return trade-off curve, allowing you to observe the direct impact of these parameters.
</aside>

### Optimal Portfolio Display

Below the input parameters, the application displays the **Optimal Portfolio** characteristics based on your selections:

*   **Weights:** The calculated optimal weights for each asset in the portfolio. These weights represent the proportion of your total investment allocated to each asset.
*   **Risk (Std Dev):** The standard deviation of the portfolio's return, representing the portfolio's risk level.
*   **Expected Return:** The expected return of the optimized portfolio.

### Risk-Return Trade-off Curve

This section visualizes the fundamental concept of the risk-return trade-off. The graph displays:

*   **Trade-off Curve:** A line plot showing the relationship between portfolio risk (standard deviation) and expected return for different levels of risk aversion (γ). Each point on this curve represents an optimally constructed portfolio for a specific risk aversion value.
*   **Annotated Points:** Two red markers on the curve, each labeled with a specific risk aversion value (γ). These points highlight portfolios optimized for different risk preferences.

<aside class="negative">
The <b>Risk-Return Trade-off Curve</b> is a core concept in portfolio theory. It demonstrates that for every level of risk you are willing to take, there is a maximum expected return you can achieve, and vice versa. This curve helps investors understand the efficient frontier of possible portfolios.
</aside>

### Return Distribution

To further understand the risk and return characteristics, the application displays **Return Distributions** for the two risk aversion values marked on the trade-off curve.

*   **Return Distribution Plots:** These plots show the probability density function (PDF) of the portfolio returns for the selected risk aversion values. The shape and spread of these distributions visually represent the likelihood of different return outcomes and the associated risk.

### Portfolio Optimization with Leverage Limit

This interactive section introduces the concept of leverage constraints in portfolio optimization.

*   **Leverage Limit Slider:** A slider to set the maximum leverage limit for the portfolio (from 1 to 4). Leverage is the use of borrowed capital to increase potential returns, but it also amplifies risk. A leverage limit restricts the total absolute sum of portfolio weights.
*   **Risk-Return Trade-off with Leverage Limit Graph:** This graph displays the risk-return trade-off curve under the specified leverage constraint. Comparing this curve with the previous trade-off curve (without leverage limit) shows how leverage constraints affect the efficient frontier.

### Asset Allocation Bar Graph

Finally, the **Asset Allocation** section provides a visual representation of the optimal portfolio weights.

*   **Asset Weights Bar Chart:** A bar chart displaying the allocation of weights across different assets in the optimal portfolio calculated for the currently selected risk aversion. This provides a clear picture of how the portfolio is constructed.

### Underlying Logic: Portfolio Optimization Process

Let's briefly outline the process behind the Portfolio Optimization page:

1.  **Synthetic Data Generation:** The application first generates synthetic data for asset returns, including mean returns (μ) and a covariance matrix (Σ). This allows for a controlled demonstration without relying on real-time market data.
2.  **Optimization Problem Formulation:** The application formulates the Markowitz portfolio optimization problem using the `cvxpy` library. The objective is to maximize the risk-adjusted return, which is defined as:  `Return - γ * Risk`, where γ is the risk aversion parameter.
3.  **Constraints:** The optimization problem includes constraints such as the budget constraint (sum of weights equals 1) and optionally the long-only constraint (weights are non-negative) and leverage constraint (norm of weights is limited).
4.  **Solving with CVXPY:** The `cvxpy` library is used to solve this convex optimization problem efficiently and find the optimal portfolio weights (w).
5.  **Visualization:** The results, including optimal weights, risk, return, risk-return trade-off curves, and return distributions, are then visualized using `plotly` and displayed in the Streamlit application.

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

def solve_portfolio_optimization(mu, Sigma, gamma_value, long_only=True, leverage_limit=None):
    n = mu.shape[0]
    w = cp.Variable(n)
    gamma = cp.Parameter(nonneg=True)
    Lmax = cp.Parameter(nonneg=True) # Leverage Parameter
    ret_expr = mu.T @ w
    risk_expr = cp.quad_form(w, Sigma)
    constraints = [cp.sum(w) == 1] # Budget constraint
    if long_only:
        constraints.append(w >= 0) # Long-only constraint
    if leverage_limit is not None:
        constraints.append(cp.norm(w, 1) <= Lmax) # Leverage constraint

    prob = cp.Problem(cp.Maximize(ret_expr - gamma * risk_expr), constraints)
    gamma.value = gamma_value
    if leverage_limit is not None:
        Lmax.value = leverage_limit
    prob.solve()
    return w.value, np.sqrt(risk_expr.value), ret_expr.value

# Example usage (inside pages/portfolio_optimization.py):
# ... (data generation, user inputs) ...
# w_opt, opt_risk, opt_return = solve_portfolio_optimization(mu, Sigma, risk_aversion, long_only) # Without leverage
# w_opt_leverage, opt_risk_leverage, opt_return_leverage = solve_portfolio_optimization(mu, Sigma, risk_aversion, long_only, selected_leverage) # With leverage
# ... (rest of the streamlit app) ...

```

<aside class="positive">
The use of <b>`cvxpy`</b> makes the portfolio optimization robust and efficient. Convex optimization techniques ensure that we find the globally optimal portfolio weights given the constraints and objective function.

## Understanding the Factor Covariance Model
Duration: 00:08

Next, navigate to the **Factor Covariance Model** page from the sidebar menu.

This page is primarily informational and explains the concept of factor covariance models. It does not have interactive elements like the Portfolio Optimization page, but it provides crucial theoretical background.

The page clearly explains the factor covariance model formula:

```
Σ = F Σ̃ F^T + D
```

and defines each component:

*   **Σ:** The covariance matrix of asset returns.
*   **F:** The factor loading matrix, representing the sensitivity of assets to different factors.
*   **Σ̃:** The factor covariance matrix, representing the covariances between the factors themselves.
*   **D:** A diagonal matrix representing the idiosyncratic risk, or asset-specific risk, uncorrelated with the factors.

The page further explains how to calculate factor exposures:

```
f = F^T w
```

and the concept of factor neutrality:

```
(F^T w)_j = 0
```

Finally, it highlights the advantages of using factor models:

*   **Reduced Parameter Estimation:** Factor models significantly reduce the number of parameters needed to estimate the covariance matrix, making the estimation process more manageable, especially for large portfolios.
*   **Improved Stability:** By capturing systematic risk through factors, factor models can lead to more stable and reliable covariance matrix estimates compared to directly estimating the full covariance matrix.
*   **Systematic Risk Capture:** Factor models explicitly capture the systematic risk factors that drive asset returns, providing valuable insights into the sources of portfolio risk.

<aside class="positive">
Understanding <b>Factor Models</b> is essential for advanced portfolio management. They provide a structured way to model dependencies between assets and manage risk more effectively, especially in large and complex portfolios.
