# QuLab Codelab: Interactive Portfolio Optimization

This codelab guides you through the QuLab application, a Streamlit-based interactive tool for exploring portfolio optimization concepts. You'll learn how to use the application to understand and visualize the effects of different parameters on portfolio construction, including risk aversion, leverage limits, and asset allocation. This application is valuable for anyone learning about quantitative finance, portfolio management, or optimization techniques. The concepts explained here are Markowitz optimization, risk-return trade-offs, leverage, and factor covariance models.

## Setting Up the Environment
Duration: 00:05

Before diving into the application, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```console
pip install streamlit numpy scipy cvxpy plotly
```

This command installs Streamlit for creating the user interface, NumPy and SciPy for numerical computations, CVXPY for solving the optimization problem, and Plotly for generating interactive visualizations.

## Running the Application
Duration: 00:02

Save the provided Python code as `app.py`.  Then, navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal and run the application using:

```console
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will launch the QuLab application in your web browser.

## Exploring the User Interface
Duration: 00:05

The application has a simple and intuitive user interface.

*   **Sidebar:** The sidebar contains the application title, logo, navigation, and user-configurable parameters.
*   **Main Panel:**  The main panel displays interactive visualizations and explanations related to portfolio optimization.

## Understanding the Portfolio Optimization Concepts
Duration: 00:15

The application begins with an overview of the key concepts in portfolio optimization:

*   **Portfolio Allocation Vector (w):**  Represents the proportion of investment allocated to each asset.
*   **Asset Returns (r):**  Describes the percentage change in an asset's price over time. The application assumes returns are random variables with a mean (μ) and covariance (Σ).
*   **Classical (Markowitz) Portfolio Optimization:** Aims to maximize the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio, balancing expected return and risk. The risk aversion parameter (γ) controls this balance.

<aside class="positive">
    <b>Key Concept:</b> Portfolio optimization is about finding the best allocation of assets to achieve a desired level of return while managing risk.
</aside>

## Interacting with the Application
Duration: 00:10

Now, let's experiment with the application's interactive elements.

1.  **Number of Assets (n):** Use the slider to adjust the number of assets in the portfolio. Observe how this affects the complexity of the optimization problem and the resulting portfolio allocation.

2.  **Risk Aversion (γ):**  Adjust the risk aversion parameter using the slider. Higher values indicate a greater aversion to risk, leading to more conservative portfolios. Notice how the risk-return trade-off curve changes.

3.  **Long-Only Portfolio:** Check or uncheck the "Long-Only Portfolio" box. When checked, the portfolio can only hold positive weights (no short selling).  Observe how this constraint affects the feasible portfolio set.

## Visualizing the Risk-Return Trade-off
Duration: 00:15

The **Risk-Return Trade-off Curve** is a fundamental concept in portfolio optimization. The application visualizes this curve using a scatter plot.

*   **X-axis:** Represents the risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio.
*   **Y-axis:** Represents the expected return of the portfolio.
*   **Each Point:** Represents an optimal portfolio for a given level of risk aversion (γ).

The chart also annotates two points on the curve, highlighting the impact of different risk aversion values on the optimal portfolio. Observe how the portfolio composition changes as you move along the curve.

<aside class="positive">
    <b>Key Concept:</b> The risk-return trade-off curve shows the range of possible portfolios, balancing risk and return.  Moving along the curve represents different investment strategies based on risk tolerance.
</aside>

## Analyzing Return Distributions
Duration: 00:10

The **Return Distribution** plot visualizes the probability of different return outcomes for two different risk aversion values.

*   **X-axis:** Represents the return.
*   **Y-axis:** Represents the probability density.

Observe how the shape of the distribution changes with different risk aversion values.  A wider distribution indicates higher risk, while a narrower distribution indicates lower risk.

## Exploring Leverage Limits
Duration: 00:10

The **Portfolio Optimization with Leverage Limit** section allows you to explore the impact of leverage constraints on portfolio optimization.

1.  **Select Leverage Limit:** Use the slider to set a leverage limit.  Leverage is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the portfolio weights.

Observe how the risk-return trade-off curve changes with different leverage limits. Limiting leverage restricts the portfolio's ability to take on risk, leading to a different set of optimal portfolios.

## Understanding Asset Allocation
Duration: 00:10

The **Asset Allocation Bar Graph** visualizes the optimal portfolio weights for each asset.

*   **X-axis:** Represents the asset number.
*   **Y-axis:** Represents the portfolio weight.

Examine the bar graph to understand how the assets are allocated in the optimal portfolio.  Observe how the allocation changes as you adjust the risk aversion and leverage limit parameters.

<aside class="negative">
    <b>Important Note:</b> Negative weights indicate short positions (selling borrowed assets).
</aside>

## Factor Covariance Model
Duration: 00:05

The application explains the Factor Covariance Model. This model represents the covariance matrix (Σ) as a function of a factor loading matrix (F), a factor covariance matrix (Σ̃), and a diagonal matrix representing idiosyncratic risk (D). Understanding factor models can help in building more robust and diversified portfolios.

## Application Architecture

The application follows a simple structure:

1.  **User Input:** Streamlit components (sliders, checkboxes) capture user preferences.
2.  **Data Generation:** A `generate_synthetic_data` function creates synthetic data for portfolio optimization, including mean returns (μ) and covariance matrix (Σ).
3.  **Portfolio Optimization:** A `solve_portfolio_optimization` function solves the Markowitz optimization problem using CVXPY, considering constraints like long-only and leverage limits.
4.  **Visualization:**  Plotly is used to create interactive visualizations, including risk-return trade-off curves, return distributions, and asset allocation bar graphs.

## Modifying the Application (Optional)
Duration: 00:15

Feel free to modify the `app.py` code to experiment with different aspects of portfolio optimization. Here are some ideas:

*   **Implement different optimization objectives:**  Try maximizing the Sharpe ratio instead of the risk-adjusted return.
*   **Add different constraints:**  Introduce sector or industry constraints on asset allocation.
*   **Incorporate real-world data:**  Replace the synthetic data with historical stock price data.
*   **Add more visualizations:**  Create visualizations to analyze portfolio diversification or factor exposures.

<aside class="positive">
    <b>Tip:</b> Use Streamlit's documentation to learn more about available components and customization options.

## Conclusion
Duration: 00:03

Congratulations! You have completed the QuLab codelab and gained a better understanding of portfolio optimization concepts and how to use this Streamlit application to explore them interactively.  Remember to experiment with the application and modify the code to deepen your understanding and build your own custom portfolio optimization tools.
